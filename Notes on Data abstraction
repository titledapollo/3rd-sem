Data abstraction:
 in the context of algorithms refers to the practice of separating the logical view of data from its physical implementation. It involves presenting only the essential information about data to the user or other parts of a program, while hiding the complex underlying details of how that data is stored and manipulated.
Key aspects of data abstraction in algorithms:
Hiding complexity: Data abstraction simplifies the interaction with data by concealing the intricate data structures and their internal workings. For example, when using a list or a queue in an algorithm, a programmer interacts with operations like "add," "remove," or "peek" without needing to know the specific array or linked list implementation details.
Focus on interface: It emphasizes the interface of a data type or structure, defining what operations can be performed on the data, rather than how those operations are implemented. This allows developers to use data types effectively without getting bogged down in the specifics of their internal logic.
Modularity and reusability: By abstracting data, algorithms can be designed to work with generic data types, promoting modularity and reusability. For instance, a sorting algorithm can be written to sort any collection of comparable elements, regardless of whether they are integers, strings, or custom objects, as long as the underlying data type provides a comparison mechanism.
Data independence: Data abstraction enables changes in the underlying data representation without affecting the algorithms that use the data. If the internal implementation of a data structure is modified (e.g., changing from an array-based list to a linked list), the algorithms using that list can continue to function correctly as long as the abstract interface remains consistent.
